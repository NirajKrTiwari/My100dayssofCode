Abstract Class
----------------
A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java
1. Abstract class (0 to 100%)
2. Interface (100%)

A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.
