Runtime polymorphism
----------------------

Polymorphism in Java

Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways. 
Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.

Runtime Polymorphism in Java

Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.

Example:
class Bike{  
  void run(){System.out.println("running");}  
}  
class Splendor extends Bike{  
  void run(){System.out.println("running safely with 60km");}  
  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
    Bike b = new Splendor();
    b.run();  
  }  
}  

Output:
running safely with 60km.
