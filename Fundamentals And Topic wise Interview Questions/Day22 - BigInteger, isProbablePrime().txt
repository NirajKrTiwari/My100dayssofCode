BigInteger
-----------
BigInteger class is used for the mathematical operation which involves very big integer calculations that are outside the limit of all available primitive data types.

In this way, BigInteger class is very handy to use because of its large method library and it is also used a lot in competitive programming. 
Now below is given a list of simple statements in primitive arithmetic and its analogous statement in terms of BigInteger objects.

Example:
BigInteger A, B;
A = BigInteger.valueOf(54);
B = new BigInteger(“123456789123456789”);

Java BigInteger isProbablePrime() Method
-----------------------------------------
The isProbablePrime() method of Java BigInteger class is used to determine if the given number is prime or not. For certainty =1, this method returns true if this BigInteger is prime and false if this BigInteger is composite.

Syntax:
public boolean isProbablePrime(int certainty)  
Parameter:
certainty - A measure of the uncertainty that the caller is willing to tolerate: if the call returns true the probability that this BigInteger is prime exceeds (1 - 1/2certainty). The execution time of this method is proportional to the value of this parameter.

Returns:
This method returns true if this BigInteger is probably prime, false if it's definitely composite.

Exception:
NA
