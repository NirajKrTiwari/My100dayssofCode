What is Array?
Ans: 
An array is a collection of similar type of elements which has a contiguous memory location. It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.
Array in Java is index-based, the first element of the array is stored at the 0th index, 2nd element is stored on the 1st index, and so on.

Advantages
Code Optimization: It makes the code optimized, we can retrieve or sort the data efficiently.
Random access: We can get any data located at an index position.

Disadvantages
Size Limit: We can store only the fixed size of elements in the array. It doesn't grow its size at runtime. To solve this problem, a collection framework is used in Java which grows automatically.

There are two types of arrays.
1. Single-Dimensional Array:
A different way to create a Single-Dimensional Array in java
int a[]=new int[5];//declaration and instantiation
int a[]={33,3,4,5};//declaration, instantiation and initialization

2. Multidimensional Array:
A different way to create a Multidimensional Array in java
int[][] arr=new int[3][3]; //declaration and instantiation
int arr[][]={{1,2,3},{2,4,5},{4,4,5}}; //declaration, instantiation and initialization
